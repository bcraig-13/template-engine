## Description
This app will start by asking the manager's name and information. Once the manager's information has been entered the user may choose to add another manager, engineer, or intern. Each option will ask the user for information about each employee. The user may enter as many employees as they like. Once finished, select done and the app will generate an html page with the information entered by the user.
## Installation
Open template-engine/main in your terminal. Run 'node app.js' to begin the prompt.
## Usage
